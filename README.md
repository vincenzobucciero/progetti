/** 
    
    I am a boy who studies computer science at the university of Naples Parthenope.
    These are projects that have been assigned to me in the first semester of programming 1. I
    had so many difficulties because I had never programmed before and I am proud of myself.
    Inside the folders you will find all the files necessary to understand the two projects (read the readme file).
    Inside the codes (main.c, function.c, header.h) you will find all the comments to the various functions to better understand.
    The ide I used is Code :: Blocks.
    For any information about the codes contact me..!!!!
